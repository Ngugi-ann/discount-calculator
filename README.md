# Discount Calculator

This project contains a Python function named `calculate_discount` that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount is 20% or higher, the discount is applied; otherwise, the original price is returned.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Enter the original price of an item when prompted.
3. Enter the discount percentage.
4. The script will output the final price after applying the discount or the original price if the discount is less than 20%.
